== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Number User Nicename, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-number-user-nicename/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-number-user-nicename/) . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
